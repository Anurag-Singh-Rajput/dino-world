HEYOOO,

This is my project on the task that was given in DevStart organised by MANAN.

This project is using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and a little bit of JS , where i have used AnimeJS library for minimalistic animations.
This simple, minimalist UI website is also responsive to a great extent.

With some custom image, and color, and custom button animations, this website is a great treat for a user
